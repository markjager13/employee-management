# Employee Management App

### Project Introduction
Employee Management App allows users to manage a list of employees and to perform insert, update, and delete actions. This project originated from a desire to build a full stack application using Spring Boot on the backend. I saw this as a great opportunity to take my Java skills to the next level and to become better aquainted with the Spring Boot ecosystem. Additionally, I wanted to learn CI/CD concepts and automate the build and deployment process of my app. Implementing these features allowed me to gain better insight into the software development process. 

### Current Features:
* Spring Boot Backend API
* React Frontend
* Maven
* Docker
* Postgres Database
* AWS RDS and Elastic Beanstalk
* CI/CD
* Deployment automation using GitHub Actions
* Deployment monitoring with Slack notifications
* Unit and Integration testing

### This project is ongoing...:building_construction:

As I add new features I will update this README to include better descriptions, images, and a live demo link.
